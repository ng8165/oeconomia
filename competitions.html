                <h3>Who should join:</h3>
                <div>Anyone! Students who have taken AP Economics will be put in one group (Adam Smith) while students who have not taken AP Economics will be put in another group (David Ricardo). This is to ensure that individuals are paired with those with similar skill levels.</div>

                <h3>How it works:</h3>
                <div>Teams of 3-4 people take an online qualifying test of 30 questions in 30 minutes (each person takes the exam separately). The top 3 scores from each team are added together to get the final score. The top 5 teams of each region will advance to States, where both a written and buzzer round will take place.  Winners of states take a longer test to filter out the top four teams in the nation, who get to travel to New York, on an all expenses paid trip, where they compete for the top spot.</div>

                <div>Teams of 4 people take a written test in order to seed the 64 total teams for the buzzer round (quiz bowl style). The results are decided ultimately by the buzzer round, but the written test is important to get good match-ups for the buzzer rounds.</div>

Through the contest, student competitors hone their academic and professional skills and exhibit their knowledge to future employers and academic programs. <strong>Competitors must construct a convincing argument using economic theory and real-world examples.</strong> Winning essays will be published in the Harvard Economics Review and will be available for the greater Harvard community to read. Essays should focus on argumentation supported with facts and references, although data-based support is also welcome.</div>
